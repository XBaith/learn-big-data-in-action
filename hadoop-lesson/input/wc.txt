Since I went to high school,
my parents moved to the city that was near my school.
Moving to the new environment meant I had to give up a lot of things,
such as my dear old friends and the beautiful scenery.
At first, I learned to get used to the strange environment.
When I have time, I would walk around the street, trying to get familiar with the shops and the streets.
Then I found some interesting places, like the small coffee shop. The shop had many books, and I could read books there.
As I had not many friends, I felt lonely here, but my classmates were very nice, and they helped me to solve problems.
Now I have made many good friends and feel like at home in this big city. I will find more surprises here.
